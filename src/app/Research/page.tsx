                    My research generally focuses on the metaphysics of intensional entities: properties,
                    relations, states of affairs, and other things of that ilk. In my most recent publication{' '}

                    I develop an alternative to the &lsquo;Simple Theory of Types&rsquo; that is commonly used
                    in the context of higher-order metaphysics. My current work focuses on the task of
                    expanding this theory into a more full-fledged ontology.

                    In OTT (the paper), I express skepticism not only about Simple Type Theory, but also
                    about:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>plural logic (fn. 62) and</li>
                    <li>a topic-neutral concept of parthood (ยง6.2).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In work that is currently unpublished, I defend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a conception of relations as sets of sequences of &lsquo;roles&rsquo; and</li>
                    <li>
                        the thesis that fundamentality (as understood in the context of OTT) is itself a
                        fundamental property.
