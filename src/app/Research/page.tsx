                    My research generally focuses on the metaphysics of intensional entities: properties,
                    relations, states of affairs, and other things of that ilk. In my most recent publication{' '}

                    I develop an alternative to the &lsquo;Simple Theory of Types&rsquo; that is commonly used
                    in the context of higher-order metaphysics. In the same paper, I express skepticism not
                    only about Simple Type Theory, but also about:

                    I further propose that sets are a special case of properties (or can be profitably{' '}

                    is&mdash;at least in my eyes&mdash;attractively elegant: there are no
                    &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; objects other than states of affairs and roles; and likewise, there
                    are no &lsquo;complex&rsquo; entities other than states of affairs and roles.
